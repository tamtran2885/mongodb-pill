Go to the official MongoDB website and download the Community version of the engine from [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

#### On Windows:

Execute the installer.

#### On UNIX / MacOS:

Extract the content of the tgz file and move it to a directory on your PATH system variable:

```sh
sudo cp /path/to/the/mongodb-directory/bin/* /usr/local/bin/
```

Check that the engine is properly installed with the following command on your teerminal

```sh
mongo --version

>> MongoDB shell version v5.0.0
```

Create a directory to store MongoDB Data

```sh
mkdir mongodb-data
```

Start the MongoDB server

```sh
mongod --dbpath mongodb-data
```

After some logs from the server, you should see a message like this:

```sh
{"t":{"$date":"2021-07-15T16:41:47.587+02:00"},"s":"I",  "c":"NETWORK",  "id":23016,   "ctx":"listener","msg":"Waiting for connections","attr":{"port":27017,"ssl":"off"}}
```

Start the database client on a diferent terminal

```sh
mongo
```

Create a new databse
